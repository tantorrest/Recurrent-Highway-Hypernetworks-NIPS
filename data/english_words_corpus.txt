poehl warns against further dollar fall bundesbank president karl otto poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit he said the united states could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet u s demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home a further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful he said he said he shared some of the u s concern about japan s trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said this was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues he said but he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar s value could overshoot

bankers trust lt bt puts brazil on non accrual bankers trust new york corp said it has placed its approximately mln dlrs of medium and long term loans to brazil on non accrual status and that first quarter net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result brazil suspended interest payments on its billion dlrs of medium and long term debt on february u s banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are days overdue but bankers trust said it acted now because of the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the day limit in the second quarter of assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of bankers trust estimated that full year net income would be reduced by about mln dlrs bankers trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments the negotiations resume in new york on friday when central bank governor francisco gros is expected to ask banks for a day rollover of some billion dlrs of term debt that matures on april

reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by to pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push

john dosher dosher said last year s fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost u s chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the

or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said but i think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable

deficit cuts seen unable to cure trade deficit financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year s federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the u s trade deficit or buoy the economy the house of representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by billion dlrs similarly the senate budget committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about billion dlrs next year in terms of the economy billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said stanley collander a touche ross federal budget policy analyst at best it will have a small positive effect collander said in an interview federal reserve board chairman paul volcker has repeatedly told congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar the u s government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar but volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar s value is fraught with danger such a decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit in addition in february u s officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels as part of that agreement japan and west germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the united states agreed to cut its budget deficit the alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit volcker said recently is to reduce u s consumption particularly federal spending if you don t deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive volcker said in recent testimony before the senate banking committee volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government s purse strings than have the fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the united states analysts say that fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession kemper financial services economist john silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none but he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the federal reserve board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets there s no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the fed s flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it s not enough silvia told reuters the u s trade deficit has become one of the government s most vexing and persistent problems the deficit was billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year s figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about to billion dlrs by year s end in the past volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget on the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the period by last year s gramm rudman balanced budget law while the new law set a ceiling of billion dlrs for next year s federal deficit both the house and senate budget committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about billion dlrs for political reasons to billion dlrs is about the most you re going to get out of congress at the present time said touche ross s collander to do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult collander said the real danger for congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its budget panels to an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained anything less than that will now look like a failure to wall street the budget plan now under debate on the house floor would lower an estimated billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on october one to about billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year the senate budget committee has called for a deficit of nearly billion dlrs with about billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts

bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey pre released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive u s current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of u s imports and a sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the u s and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said a reduction in the u s current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the u s current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the u s but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the u s when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of non inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

u s said to view g meeting as major success the united states which has long sought japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied tokyo s latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies monetary sources said they believed that u s treasury secretary james baker considered tokyo s package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the japanese economy but yesterday s statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen s rise from around to the dollar the level at the february paris accord to about today and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so the yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the bank of japan kiichi miyazawa japan s finance minister said the movement since paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks i would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris miyazawa said yesterday the supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of miyazawa s departure for washington to attend yesterday s meetings of leading industrial nations in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the paris accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollar s fall while relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years monetary sources also said they understood that secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the japanese announcement they also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium term policies has replaced the bickering over short term differences in past meetings west germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the paris agreement appears from the face of yesterday s statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable bonn s finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between west germany and japan s trade surpluses and america s trade deficit have already taken place no mention was made however of the u s commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of paris european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record u s trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker a further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent fed to drive up interest rates monetary sources said that privately west germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the u s unit bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts tokyo s export drive to the united states the japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets the ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one canadian finance minister michael wilson said good progress was made wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations the united states and france backed by the international monetary fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has bonn and london worried monetary sources say because it implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the february meeting the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years

global economic slowdown raises new debt fears the global economy is expected to weaken this year adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook economic analysts said for finance ministers and central bankers attending this week s semi annual meetings of the international monetary fund and world bank the new figures released by the imf add an additional concern the fund estimated world output would only grow by pct this year versus pct last year and pct in in the industrial countries gross national product a measure of all goods and services was expected to decline to pct this year compared with pct in the imf said for the developing countries the gross domestic product another measure of economic growth was expected to fall to pct from pct last year the new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries they had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt imf officials discussing their outlook said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade economic analysts and the imf have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance economic weakness in the developed nations economies poses fundamental worries debtor countries including the very poorest states have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange including the key one of exports the u s economy which is in its fifth year of expansion has served as a mainstay for developing country exports but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year growing by only pct according to the imf for this reason and because of a high trade deficit the united states has been pressuring japan and west germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success the imf study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the u s trade deficit reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up although it has been much slower than expected the imf observed in its world economic outlook that it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect the report added however the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion reuter m

lawson says some countries could cut rates nigel lawson britain s chancellor of the exchequer said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability speaking to journalists one day after the group of seven countries reaffirmed goals set in paris six weeks ago he said central banks would continue to intervene as and when necessary he said the g countries were concerned that japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa yesterday lawson said he was still worried about the risk of a simultaneous recession in the united states japan and west germany though less so than when he gave his march budget speech to the british parliament if anything i m a little bit less concerned but there is still a risk he said asked if the united states should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar he said if there is a need for changes in relative interest rates it doesn t need to be a rise in interest rates in the united states lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday s meetings at the slow progress the united states had made in reducing its budget deficit we believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year the important thing is that it continue year after year lawson said the february louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then current exchange rates in the six weeks that followed the japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the louvre accord he said i don t think so if there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness although intervention could be a cause of inflation lawson said the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode but one has to be vigilant he said yesterday s g statement which affirmed that current levels of exchange rates were appropriate had been carefully worded we know what we mean and we all mean the same thing he said lawson said financial markets seem to believe that japanese measures outlined in the louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement therefore the g countries welcomed miyazawa s presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand they particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending but lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year

treasury s baker says system needs stability treasury secretary james baker said the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances from emerging in the global economy in remarks before the afternoon session of the international monetary fund s interim committee baker said he was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned but i do suggest he said that we need something to give it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction when the wind shifts he said that indicators can serve as a kind of compass but added that structural indicators can help focus attention on some policies baker however said the imf needs to move beyond macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific relevance to the imbalances we face today the treasury secretary said that indicators should be given a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews article iv consultations that the fund performs baker also told the policy making group that it was time for the imf to adopt earlier recommendations making imf surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the public in particular we urge increased publicity for imf appraisals developed in article iv consultations the use of follow up reports on country actions to implement imf recommendations and greater use of special consultation procedures he said baker emphasized that indicators were a device for moving beyond rhetoric to action he said they provide more structure to the system and induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of policy coordination he said the fund s procedures for surveillance need to be reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators this should be matter of priority for the executive board he said baker also urged the fund to develop alternative medium term economic scenarios for countries that can help us focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances by identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the implications of these options he said also that further work should be done on finding paths that lead toward possible medium term objectives if we are to take effective remedial action when there are significant deviations from an intended course then we must have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for key variables he said

analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise economists said that they doubt the federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday up from mln dlrs in the prior statement period wednesday borrowings were billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high pct one could make a case that the fed is firming but it probably isn t said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two weeks to wednesday were nearly mln dlrs after averaging around mln dlrs over the previous two months however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn t quite make it said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets a fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the fed had no large net one day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday still mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around billion dlrs they put wednesday s overnight system repos at approximately billion dlrs it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time said larry leuzzi of s g warburg and co inc citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled said mccarthy of merrill lynch he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday s washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday s g communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average fed funds rate between six and pct this is about where the rate has been since early november i m not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect said sullivan of dean witter if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around to pct from six to pct previously

u s markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare today s turmoil in the u s financial markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar s wake is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar s decline as the cure all for the u s trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became a one way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul volcker s often repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse volcker s been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he s got it said david jones economist at aubrey g lanston and co inc the dollar fell below yen today for the first time in years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one day drop in months amid worries that the dollar s slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than dlrs to a high of dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by points to norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that once you start the ball rolling it s difficult to stop there s a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in a panic stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of marks and yen in february could turn into a nightmare we re still more or less on track for a hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession the stock market s reaction today and its sharp drop on march shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast a drop to about yen marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar s latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the g paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of a debilitating trade war many economists believe that long run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the u s reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the g and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad at least by japan said lanston s jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion it s ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the u s budget deficit we re going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares he said noting that only the deficit cut in will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out put on your helmets giordano said

institutes divided on outlook for german economy the five leading west german economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago the three research groups of kiel hamburg and essen predicted in the institutes joint spring report that gross national product gnp would rise by two pct in compared with pct in the five institutes had jointly forecast three pct growth in october last year taking a dissenting view the diw institute of west berlin and munich s ifo institute predicted only one pct growth the joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the diw and ifo were markedly less favourable than those of the other three the diw and ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year in the second half of there will however only be a weak upward movement they said the two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year they saw exports falling by a real pct in and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year the other three institutes however wrote the decline in demand and production seen in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing they said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans but they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off it can be presumed that the braking actions on the economy will diminish markedly this year they added the domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable these three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring however this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar contrary to the diw and ifo the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year they predicted an overall pct fall in exports in the same as in the three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in compared with pct in while diw and ifo predicted a three pct increase they saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in against pct in ifo and diw saw these investments rising by only two pct all the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment the kiel hamburg and essen institutes said the jobless total would average mln in compared with mln in and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about these three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures the construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion the diw and ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector while the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline the diw and ifo said unemployment would only decline to mln in from mln in they saw the current account surplus falling in to billion marks from billion in the other three saw a current account surplus in of at least billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around billion marks from billion in the institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in after they declined in and all five predicted an average increase over the year of pct

west german institutes call for early tax cuts the five leading west german economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for in their joint spring report the institutes were divided about growth forecasts with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth gross national product grew pct last year but the report said all the institutes believed that more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created the institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible from this point of view the tax reform planned for should be brought forward the government plans gross tax reductions of billion marks as part of the major tax reform the net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to billion marks however the institutes criticised the government not only for the timing of the reform but also because the question of its financing had been left open the government has not specified how the remaining billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies the institutes said this lack of clarity from bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government they also said the government should reduce tax preferences which would simplify the fiscal system urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value added tax the institutes also criticised bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged they referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for and described this as an increase in subsidies the institutes said total subsidies including tax preferences had reached billion marks in and risen further since then given the scope of these subsidies it should be possible despite major political difficulties to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts the institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost the report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed the government had to aim for more competition it said

g seems worried markets ignore coordination top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies which they believe they strengthened in talks last week monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too did not take heed of the policy commitments of the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada treasury secretary james baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement and french finance minister edouard balladur underscored that by saying i don t believe at all that the americans want a weaker dollar west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said the dollar s latest rapid descent involves the risk now already a tangible threat of a new strong surge of inflation leading to a renewed rise in interest rates but there were signs too that while policymakers feared the market uproar they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week s semi annual meetings of the imf and the world bank for higher u s interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar s rapid descent that distaste stems in part from fears of recession outgoing deputy treasury secretary richard darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the u s trade deficit it would slow growth in germany and japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us if not into recession into slower growth he said asked if higher u s interest rates would stabilize the dollar balladur said when a currency is maintained artificially high by artificially high interest rates it is not healthy and resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession he said acknowledging the dollar s latest slide was now a fact of life balladur said there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies this is not a fixed rate system but federal reserve board chairman paul volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar s slide deepens u s monetary sources also said washington wanted it understood by markets the seven s commitments were genuine the united states and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements baker told the meetings darman said baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar baker darman said was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels last week s statement from the seven reaffirmed a february agreement in paris in which the reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with congress and to fight protectionism west germany and japan meanwhile agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn ministers believed the paris pact was bolstered by japan s promise of a billion dlr supplementary budget the sources said they believed baker saw it as a major action but the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today s exchange rates and not those at the time of the paris agreement when the dollar stood higher the paris accord said currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals given the policy commitments summarized in this statement now they accept the dollar s lower level especially against the yen as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement the ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals last week s statement read monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the u s trade deficit and the surpluses of west germany and japan rather than prospective policy changes european monetary sources said bonn was still unconvinced that washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit

trade issues straining ec s patience with japan member states of the european community are starting to run out of patience with japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by ec countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the ec however they said an all out trade war may be far off as ec states know they would suffer almost as much as japan senior ec diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an ec executive commission proposal under which the ec could raise tariffs on a range of japanese products if the u s carries out a threat to make a similar move on april the ec tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body gatt would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the ec market from that of the u s the diplomats were meeting as tokyo announced that the ec s trade deficit with japan reached a record billion dlrs in march up from billion in february 
ec could decide on japan trade moves in late may the european community ec has effectively given japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures ec diplomats said they said ec foreign ministers will meet on may and to review the state of trade relations between the two sides the ec executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on friday to propose a renunciation of some ec pledges to the world trade body gatt unless there are adequate and early measures to open the japanese market such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties or quantitative limits on japanese exports the diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of ec foreign ministers on april and in luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action they said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent japanese exports of electrical photographic and other goods being diverted to europe following of possible u s tariff moves in may the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of spain and portugal joining the bloc which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods japan s trade surplus with the community has grown steadily registering a record billion dlrs in march

german institutes warn on money supply four of west germany s five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation but in a dissenting view the diw institute in west berlin echoing recent statements by leading bundesbank officials said the expansion seen over the last years did not necessarily threaten stability the five institutes issued a joint spring report in which three kiel hamburg and essen forecast a two pct rise in gnp in while west berlin and munich predicted one pct the four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity but experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy given virtual zero inflation in west germany such fears may seem exaggerated they said but it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy they said the economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold they said the four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply they said a return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations the diw institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability the inflation following strong money growth reflected other causes such as rising oil prices and the falling mark

u s banks likely to lift prime rates again soon major u s banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said in what was the first prime rate boost since mid most banks in early april lifted their rates a quarter point to pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money that spread has narrowed again a prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc brusca said a quarter point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point he said that spread had averaged around percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week said david jones of aubrey g lanston and co we ve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future said allan leslie of discount corp based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now said harold nathan economist at wells fargo bank however he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar he said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle u s inflation as the dollar fell to a year low against the yen friday currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar in addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the u s currency would be for the fed to push u s interest rates higher relative to overseas rates based particularly on the fed s reserve management actions on friday and today nathan of wells fargo said it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed bank funding costs and other short and long term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected on friday the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at pct with funds trading even higher at pct today the fed arranged only a slightly larger billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements the fed s actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures said jones of lanston the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar jones said he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now but to have a major impact on the dollar the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from pct jones said a u s discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar given likely fed policy firming he said both the yield on year treasury bonds about pct now and the prime rate may be at pct at end june and nine pct by year s end the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar said leslie of discount corp he said tax date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy
