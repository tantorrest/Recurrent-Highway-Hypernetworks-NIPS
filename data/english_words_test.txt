venezuela tightens foreign exchange restrictions venezuela s central bank has ordered venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to reuters the measure confirmed by a brokerage firm here has effectively cut off all foreign participation in venezuela s volatile currency market the telex issued on may was signed by carlos hernandez delfino manager of the bank s department of international operations the telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside venezuela in recent weeks the venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar but brokers said the central bank s move is seen as a de facto currency control it is definitely a control in the sense that there s no longer complete freedom to operate one broker here said gradually they re imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control the broker said the broker who requested anonymity said virtually all his venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls he said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm s transactions with venezuela was about mln dlrs a day it was a frenetic market it was really quite active he said the broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between venezuelan brokers exchange houses and banks we weren t buying dollars from venezuelans that s ridiculous he said they ve been on a rampage against foreigners the broker noted that two months ago venezuela s central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside venezuela would have to respect a new pct reserve requirement in february the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures the broker said we used to have a forward market he said for a small currency it was miraculous he said the bolivar which averaged to the u s dollar in would continue to slip from its current range of to because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market

tokyo bundesbank s schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates tokyo bundesbank s schlesinger sees no reason to lower interest rates
no reason to cut rates bundesbank s schlesinger bundesbank vice president helmut schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now with money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in may and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark schlesinger told reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed the economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added we may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview concerned by the first quarter downturn the u s has been pressing west germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in year on year growth was thus about two pct he estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct it is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year on year pace of to eight pct well above the bundesbank s three to six pct target he said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long term capital flows heavy inflows particularly in january around the time of the ems revaluation boosted domestic money supply there is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed schlesinger said a major reason for the inflows was the market s conviction that the mark was headed higher as we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished schlesinger said the recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the u s did in march when the dollar rose above marks he said this would depend on the circumstances at midday here the dollar stood at marks central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but i cannot give any answer how they would react schelsinger said one has to look at how it the market is moving he said adding it is not only our own case it is also the american case he said that the west german export industry has been hit hard by the dollar s sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now but it wouldn t be good to have short term fluctuations he said let us wait and see it is mainly the strength of the dollar fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level of rates as such schlesinger said the sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on west german inflation down year although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices the underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to pct he said schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation the above target growth of money supply over the past months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid year meeting of the bundesbank s council schlesigner said but he added i don t see any great pressure to go away from it

central bank head says philippine growth on target the philippines first quarter growth figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely to achieve its targets central bank governor jose fernandez said in an interview the national economic development authority neda announced yesterday gross domestic product gdp grew pct and gross national product gnp pct in the first quarter from a year earlier i don t see anything on the horizon that should cut it growth short fernandez said neda said gnp had grown pct and gdp pct in the fourth quarter of from a year earlier last year s gnp growth put earlier at pct was revised to pct certainly i do not see any shortage in external resources and if gnp growth continues at this level i would assume that domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and would not be a stumbling block fernandez said i think even before the figures came out simply looking at key indicators such as consumption of fuel oil and power showed that the economy was on a different track from last year he said fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the first and second quarters because of the dry weather and it could drop off in the third quarter he said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the manufacturing sector which grew by pct after declines in and a slow turnaround in the second half of that is not a seasonal thing it is secular he said he said the government had met all monetary targets set for the first quarter in consultation with the international monetary fund imf it expected to draw down the fourth tranche from its mln sdr stand by arrangement soon the philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling mln sdrs from the arrangement expiring on april fernandez said an imf mission would visit here in july or august to review performance in the january june period he said imf repayments were projected to total billion dlrs over the period and drawings only mln dlrs repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their net repayments to the imf rising in the next few years it means that since there will be a net drain on oda official development assistance accounts the commercial banking system will be requested to hold the line he said it is an internal constraint that exists because the imf debt cannot be rescheduled fernandez said the philippines rescheduled billion dlrs of its billion dlr foreign commercial debt in march fernandez said central bank bills introduced in march to mop up excess liquidity had peaked at billion pesos in april but their unwinding on maturity dates started in october last year had almost been completed he said auctions of treasury bills whose outstanding level touched billion pesos on may were going well treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool he said commenting on the country s foreign debt fernandez said i think the philippine debt stock looms large because our own receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap forward as might have been suitable the foreign debt is projected by the central bank to reach billion dlrs by the end of neda said exports totalled billion dlrs in the first quarter while imports were billion dlrs fernandez said the government had targeted gnp growth of between six and pct this year he cautioned that while growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some economists that the peso currently pegged at to the dollar ought to be devalued to make the country s exports more competitive by being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso has already substantially devalued against all of the country s trading partners he said on the proposed omnibus investment code he said he was opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two years after the imposition of the code the imposition of the code scheduled for last january has been delayed by objections from some business groups i think any central bank certainly this one after the events of the past two or two and a half years has to be prudent this is not the time to throw all caution to the winds and i m not about to do that fernandez said it would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of capital and earnings can be free he said we have had one year of reasonably good results certainly we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external availabilities simply by servicing our debts

poehl looks set for eight more years at bundesbank for currency dealers karl otto poehl is the scourge of speculators for bankers he is the man who has played a key role in shaping the world s financial destiny for the last seven years and for germans he is the guardian of the mark president of the powerful and independent west german central bank the bundesbank poehl is likely to have his contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the end of this year government officials say index of economic spotlights see page ecra but no official announcement has yet been made raising eyebrows in west germany s business community the ebullient poehl spent seven years in bonn in top ministerial posts under the social democrats now in opposition before he moved to the bundesbank there has been speculation that chancellor helmut kohl would try to replace poehl with a man closer to his own christian democrats but officials noted that poehl has worked closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard stoltenberg since kohl s government took office in poehl the most senior central banker apart from paul volcker of the united states enjoys a strong international reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up given these circumstances kohl will probably overlook poehl s past as an adviser to former social democrat chancellor willy brandt and top aide to helmut schmidt when he was finance minister bankers said it was schmidt who as chancellor appointed poehl to his present job in in recent months with the mark s strong rise against the dollar poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of the bundesbank s council a highly conservative institution which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent inflation catching hold older germans can remember two bouts of galloping inflation this century but with consumer prices falling for much of and inflation negligible so far this year poehl thinks it is safe to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the dangers to the german economy of a bloated exchange rate i am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the dollar mark rate have reached a high priority also for the bundesbank because a further massive revaluation of the mark would endanger the economy in west germany he told business journalists in frankfurt recently ute geipel head of research at citibank ag says that poehl s reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy poehl s policy has always been a policy which does not focus so rigidly on domestic factors but also on the external economy she said an economist at a german bank who declined to be identified said if poehl is confirmed in his post it will certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so rigidly oriented towards money supply one of poehl s great struggles recently has been to persuade the united states to stop talking down the dollar for poehl the significance of the february louvre accord was that the united states agreed to join efforts to stabilise currencies the louvre accord was greeted with scepticism by currency dealers who said they would soon put it to the test but in fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact this is because the markets know or perhaps because they don t know what the central banks can do poehl says of intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates round making a speculator s position worthless poehl was born in and worked as a financial journalist in the s before starting his ministerial career a relaxed sun tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over a glass of beer he is hardly a stereotype central banker he is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and play golf poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced but you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount if you strike at the right moment he said bundesbank dealers are very professional and skilled they ve burnt the fingers of many people he said and unlike the speculators poehl notes the bundesbank dealers usually make a profit

china seen unlikely to raise sugar imports china will not increase sugar imports substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints and large stocks despite falling production and rising domestic demand traders and the official press said despite rapid increases in domestic production over the last years imbalances between supply and demand continue to be extremely serious the farmers daily said it said plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives because farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated the official press had estimated the sugar crop november march at mln tonnes down from mln a year earlier and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year the yunnan sugar harvest was a record tonnes the provincial daily said it gave no year earlier figure output in guangxi was mln tonnes the new china news agency said without giving a year earlier figure the nanfang daily said production in guangdong province fell to estimated mln tonnes from mln and that the area under sugar was dropping supply of cane in guangdong is inadequate the newspaper said processing costs are rising and the economic situation of nearly all the mills is not good to guarantee supply of cane is a major problem a western diplomat said sugar output also fell n fujian south china s fourth major producer where there was a drop in area planted he said the rural sectors in guangdong and fujian were wel developed enabling farmers to choose crops according to the maximum return meaning that many had avoided sugar the farmers daily said a peasant in the ortheast province of heilongjiang could gross yuan from one mu hectares of soybeans and yuan from one mu of corn but only from one mu of sugarbeet the paper said the profit margin of mills in china fell to pct last year from pct in mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed with each other for raw materialsx it added this resulted in falling utilisation rates at big mode nised mills the price of sugar had not changed in years the official press has said customs figures showed china imported mln tonnes of sugar in calendar down from mln in the diplomat said stocks at end august were mln tonnes up from a year earlier a foreign trader here said china accumulated large stocks in when provincial authorities were allowed to import sugar on their own authority this practice was stopped in when the central government resumed control of imports as china lacked storage much of these imports was stored in qinghai inner mongolia and other inland areas the diplomat said the trader said transporting stocks from these areas to consumers in east and south china was a problem particularly as coal had priority how quickly they can move the sugar is one factor determining import levels he said another factor was the quality of the harvest in cuba china s major supplier through barter trade he said china bought two distress cargoes last week for about dlrs a tonne he added china is not a desperate buyer now but if the cuban harvest is bad it will have to go into the open market a japanese trader said peking s major concern regarding imports was price while the foreign trade situation has improved this year foreign exchange restraints persist he said the diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five pct a year but a communist government is in a much better position to regulate demand than a capitalist one if the foreign exchange situation demands it

s africa expected to unveil expansionary budget south africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation s flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education finance minister barend du plessis is expected to raise significantly the government s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said analysts expect du plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on april while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said rob lee chief economist at south african mutual life assurance co south africa this year is targeting inflation adjusted growth in gdp of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct growth in gdp over the past decade has averaged about pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over pct economists estimate that the government s spending target will rise to about billion rand with revenue budgeted at around billion rand this would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of gdp the government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said the budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said standard bank ltd in a budget preview many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets south african mutual s lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around billion rand this year leaving a deficit of between and pct of gdp compared with a three pct limit suggested by the imf the imf limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that south africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the imf over the past two years the policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in september against a background of western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective but private sector economists caution that the government s ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country s balance of payments most of that surplus this year estimated at around billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation s estimated billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks within these constraints economists believe du plessis has little room to manoeuvre analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state owned post office and south african transport services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely du plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini budget before the may whites only election the poll delayed presentation of the national budget this will not be a very exciting budget commented harry schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal progressive federal party i do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election

lawson says louvre currency accord satisfactory the louvre agreement by the group of seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in venice on june u k chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said previewing the summit which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth side measures to boost growth he said i think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely he made no mention of japanese interest rates lawson said the u s should embark on a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years he said the february louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of group of seven central banks and he was content with sterling s exchange rate pointing to the record billion stg rise in u k may currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing a very full part ourselves we have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto lawson said there was a risk that the louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro economic commitments underlying the accord certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in paris in this respect he said the u s budget deficit was very important noting the billion yen economic package announced by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone last week lawson said what is really needed in japan is an increase in merchandise imports supply side measures are critical there is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said lawson doubted that tokyo s partners would indulge in japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of nakasone s plans to increase japanese development aid over the next three years japan s more flexible stance on tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said he said he thought west germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth in this respect lawson said he hoped bonn would bring forward to january part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for he also called on bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of german national industries on debt lawson said he expected a three point british plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub saharan countries to make progress in venice the plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the paris club was first proposed at the imf and world bank meetings in washington earlier this year lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the autumn meetings of the imf and world bank he welcomed the recent moves by citicorp and chase manhattan to increase sharply their third world debt provisions first it is a blow for realism second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before citicorp he said u k banks should follow bank of england recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions they have done it to some extent they need to do it more lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions he also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit there is a consensus which we have to push further
