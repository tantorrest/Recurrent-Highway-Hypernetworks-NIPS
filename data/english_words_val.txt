japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across japan s bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide u s officials said but robert crandall a trade specialist at brookings institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the u s officials said the pct tariffs reagan ordered on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that a tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to u s products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing u s trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the u s trade gap last year was a record billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america s overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that i regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the u s semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement u s officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write a trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn t done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated

fed data provide new evidence of tighter policy u s banking data released today are too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary policy but they do support the market s assumption that the federal reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit economists said it s clear that the fed has firmed somewhat discount window borrowings net free reserves the fed funds rate average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent with a modest tightening said dana johnson of first chicago corp johnson and several other economists now estimate that the fed funds rate should trade between and pct discount window borrowings in the week to wednesday were mln dlrs a day producing a daily average for the two week statement period of mln dlrs the highest since the week of december and up from mln dlrs previously moreover banks were forced to borrow a huge billion dlrs from the fed on wednesday the highest daily total this year even though unexpectedly low treasury balances at the fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in reserves than the fed had anticipated however economists said it is almost certain that the fed is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than witnessed this week they pointed to two factors that may have forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week first economists now expect m money supply for the week ended april to rise by a staggering to billion dlrs partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to pay annual income taxes as banks checking account liabilities rise so do the reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the fed required reserves did indeed rise sharply by billion dlrs a day in the two weeks ended wednesday but economists said the fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the projected m surge until late in the week and so started to add reserves too late second an apparent shortage of treasury bills apparently left wall street dealers with too little collateral with which to enagage in repurchase agreements with the fed economists said thus although there were billion dlrs of repos outstanding on wednesday night the fed may have wanted to add even more reserves but was prevented from doing so it s not at all inconceivable that the fed didn t add as much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch economics inc mccarthy estimated that the fed is now targetting discount window borrowings of about mln dlrs a day equivalent to a fed funds rate of around pct after citing the reasons why the fed probably has not tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data economists said the fact that the fed delayed arranging overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy jeffrey leeds of chemical bank had not been convinced that the fed was tightening policy but after reviewing today s figures he said it s fair to say that the fed may be moving toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture leeds expects fed funds to trade between and pct and said the fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate unless the dollar s fall gathers pace johnson at first chicago agreed citing political opposition in washington to a dollar defense package at a time when congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to reducing the u s trade surplus with japan

u s study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation s swelling trade deficit a government study said in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make u s products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the u s economy it said the page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to a record billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing u s consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating u s industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said although each industry s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all u s industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the s it also said it found a fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates u s economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries a lack of investment in u s industry declining research and development in u s industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the s and u s antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit

philippine coconut chief to lobby against ec tax philippine coconut authority pca chairman jose romero said he would visit brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed pct european community ec levy on vegetable oil imports i intend to visit brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the philippines romero said in an interview he said he did not know how much support the levy had within the ec but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position romero said a group of ec members led by west germany the netherlands denmark and norway were opposed to the tax but there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides and if that happened opposition could crumble romero said another threat to exports lay in an ec warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin a carcinogenic chemical he said the ec standard of parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal which ec countries had been asked to apply by october was too rigid he said philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in london that the philippines was doing its best to meet ec standards it was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally but this was likely to take several years of research copra meal exports were tonnes or pct of total coconut exports in the meal was worth mln dlrs romero said he would also visit oxford university s department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether there are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra romero said we can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non food products or we can go to the chemical root he said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop in the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production and i m not comfortable with that he said with countries like indonesia and malaysia stepping up production of palm oil a coconut oil substitute palm oil output had risen nearly pct since romero said to add to that the u s soybean association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart he said romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year they would probably touch a high of cents pound from the current level of cents and a sharp rise from year ago levels of cents romero said the philippines was at the end of a five year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests he said and were good harvests and this year to add to the production fall drought had affected output traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again the only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing adding more value he said coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees he said a typical farm may have from to trees sitting on square metres of land that s a lot of space romero said he said the government s proposed land reform program would exclude about pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven hectares of land if the idea of land reform is to increase income levels production and employment then it won t happen he said pca figures show about one third of the country s population is dependent on the coconut industry coconuts are planted on about mln hectares or one fourth of total agricultural land
